# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Model-Refinement
Analyzed time series data using linear and quadratic models to predict daily prices. Tested for serial correlation in raw data and residuals from both models. Applied resampling methods to quantify prediction uncertainty and refined models for improved accuracy, yielding insights into price trends and dynamics.
