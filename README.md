# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Model-Refinement
Analyzed time series data using linear and quadratic models to predict daily prices. Tested for serial correlation in raw data and residuals from both models. Applied resampling methods to quantify prediction uncertainty and refined models for improved accuracy, yielding insights into price trends and dynamics.

This project analyzes time series data to predict daily prices using linear and quadratic regression models. The goal is to assess price trends, test for serial correlation, and quantify prediction uncertainty. By applying resampling techniques and model testing, this project refines price predictions to improve forecasting accuracy.

Project Overview
The project follows these main steps:

Data Preparation: The data is organized into a daily average of prices.
Modeling: Both linear and quadratic models are used to fit the data.
Prediction & Uncertainty: Resampling is applied to generate predictions with quantifiable uncertainty.
Serial Correlation Testing: Serial correlation in both raw price data and model residuals is tested to check for significant autocorrelation.
Visualization: The results of the predictions and uncertainty are visualized to provide insights into the model performance.
Features
Linear and quadratic regression models for price prediction.
Resampling techniques for generating predictions with uncertainty.
Serial correlation tests for raw price data and residuals of both models.
Visualizations of prediction uncertainty.
Model evaluation and refinement.
